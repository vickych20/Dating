          I want to talk about to things that are quite important to me. There
          are love and one my personal inadequacies. The thing is that I’m quite
          fond of love, I think that it’s a pretty all right deal. However, I’m
          going to have to admit that my emotional baggage has built up walls
          that not even a shock and awe campaign could bring down. But I do
          love. And in fact I even love unconditionally.

          I have a truck. It’s kind of a small truck, but I’m comfortable with
          myself so that’s okay. I think that I love it. I had a friend about a
          year ago ask me if I could have any car in the world what would I
          have. And aside from pointing out that my friend and I have clearly
          ran out of things to discuss and should probably go our separate ways,
          my answer told me that I love my truck (obviously I said I would keep
          my truck).
